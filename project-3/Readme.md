Any changes you made to the Makefile or existing files that would affect grading: // TODO

Plan outlining individual contributions for each member of your group:
We plan to meet on Zoom and have one person share their screen while the
others assist by reviewing, looking up information in the writeup/documentation, etc.

Every 45 minutes, we will switch the screen sharer/typer. This should result in equal contributions for each member.
